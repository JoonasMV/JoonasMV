# Introduction

Hello, my name is Joonas. I'm currently a third year student at Metropolia. <br>
<br>
My skills primarily focus on full-stack development using JavaScript/ TypeScript and React. <br>
<br>
Additionally, I have a lot of experience with Java and I am also familiar with SQL, MongoDB and have some experience with Docker. <br>
<br>

## Here are some of my past projects

#### Android app made with Java.

User data gets saved to a PostgreSQL database trough [Trainer-API](https://github.com/ollivarila/Trainer-API). 
The app includes premade workouts for the user to choose from. Users also have the ability to create their own workout plans and share them with others.
Progress can be tracked with graphs which are created from past workouts.
 > The server running the API has been shutdown
